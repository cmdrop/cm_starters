===========

Feature exports used in Community Media Starter Kit distributions.

To submit a Feature or sub-module for inclusion in this module:
1. Capture the configuration in a Feature, for help check out: https://www.drupal.org/node/580026 or create a module.
2. Any module submitted should follow naming conventions that can be edited in the .info file. This is an example of the important parts of that file:

name = Starter: [descriptive name] 

description = [description of what the module does]

core = 7.x

package = Community Media Starters

The following example is how it should read:

name = Starter: Basic Event Calendar

description = Event content type, Fullcalendar view and Taxonomy Vocab for creating events calendar with color coded events by type.

core = 7.x

package = Community Media Starters
